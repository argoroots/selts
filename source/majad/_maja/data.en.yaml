        In 1893 the board of the cement factory opened a German-speaking elementary school for the children of the office workers in the cement factory. It served in the house which was built for the office workers. Students learned in German. Even the workers´ children were accepted to the school. Johann Sehwers worked as a teacher. Anna and Paul Öpik graduated from that school. Later the building has been used by The Kunda Primary School and Kindergarten. The house was demolished in 1997.

        Between the years 1888 and 1900 the residents of the house were the family of the constable of Port Kunda,  Karl Heinrich Öpik (1861–1944), including his wife Leontine Johanna Öpik (1861–1944).

        Their child, Ernst Julius Öpik (1893–1985) was the Estonian astronomer and astrophysicist whose most important surveys concentrated on star evolution. One of his findings proved that the life on Earth will end in 5 billion years. The asteroid 2099 Öpik is named in his honour.

        Armin Aleksander Öpik (1898–1983) was an Estonian paleontologist. He was the editor of the nature magazine Eesti Loodus and the president of the Estonian Naturalists´ Society.

        Paul Öpik (1888–1967) was a leading financier in Estonia between World War I and World War II, and his signature is on the Estonian 50-pence coin and 1-mark note (released in 1919).

        Oskar Eugen  Öpik (1895–1974) was an Estonian diplomat, who held different responsibilities in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Estonian Government.

        The daughter Anna Öpik (1886–1955) is known as the translator of the Homer´s epic Odyssey; due to her illness, another daughter Helene Hildegard Öpik (1896–1945) spent her youth under her parents´ supervision.

        In 1944 most of the Öpiks fled their native country because of the approaching Red Army.

    title: The White House

        The first report about the Lontova summer resort was published in St-Peterburger Zeitung in 1828.  The house was built next to the road which took people from the Malla Manor to the port. Later the building was more known by the name of the White House. The folklore name of the oldest borroughs of Kunda, which is called Lontova, originates from the name of the hotel Neu London. Even though there were some visitors from St. Petersburg in the hotel during the first years after the opening, the enterprise did not succeed. The hotel was closed and sold together with Kunda Manor probably in 1840. The new owners, the Girards, came to Estonia form France.  During the construction of the cement factory and before the directors´ house was built, the White House accommodated the director of the cement factory, Heinrich Ernst Eduard Bührig (1849–1927), as well as the cement factory´s doctor Moritz Luig (1854–1919). In 1940s the apartments were built in the White House.

    title: A New Schoolhouse in Kunda
    text: |
        In 1932 the local government decided to build a new schoolhouse as a part of the local cultural centre. The positive aspects of that decision were the communal central heating and running water (drilled well), and some rooms (a coatroom and a lobby) were used by visitors of both institutions.

        In 1934 a new-limestone annex (the schoolhouse) of the clubhouse was ready. There were six spacious classrooms in it, a chancellery, the doctor´s room, a staff room, a room for the teaching aids, a kitchen, a gym with Swedish ladders, a principal´s apartment, a janitor´s apartment. The school could use the assembly hall of the clubhouse.

        There were seven teachers and 218 students in the school in 1934. The school had its own garden, which was originally meant for the principal, but was later turned into a school´s experimental garden.

        Kunda Incomplete Secondary School started in 1944. In 1947 it was renamed Kunda Secondary School. In 1955 the whole building (including the club house) was given to school use. In 1953 Kalju Viise became the principal of the school, who improved the learning possibilities a lot: a dormitory, a stadium, a tennis court, smithies, playgrounds and experimental gardens were founded.

        In 1962 the Estonian secondary school and the Russian basic school were separated. The Estonian school moved into a new house.  The Russian basic school, which was called Kunda Basic School, continued its work with 11 classes. In 1973 the Kunda Basic School was named Kunda 2nd Secondary School. In 2001 two schools (Estonian and Russian) were united again.

        The idea to establish a cement factory comes from the entrepreneurial owner of Kunda manor, John Girard de Soucanton, who invited the "Russian cement father," chemist Victor Christoph Lieven, to make his idea into reality in 1869. On the 21st of October 1870 Kunda Cement Factory Ltd was formed. The factory construction work was led by architect Friedrich Wilhem Alisch and the producing of cement was started in 1872. By that time they had made a cement mill from stone with a 120-horsepower hydraulic turbine, a weir with an ice-breaker, on the top of it a bridge, connecting both sides of the river. There was also a canal covered in 49-square feet section, which connected the cement mill turbine with the slurry pool, and the clay crusher.  About 2-km-long horse railway led to the clay and marl mining as well as to the carpenter´s which were located near Kunda manor.

        The first directors' house was located near the factory. On the other side of the river in Sillaküla the factory workers' houses were located. The company was named Port Kunda and at the end of the 19th century, it was the biggest cement factory in North Russia.

        In order to better maintain and govern the cement factory, the first telephone line was put up to connect Kunda Manor, the office of the cement factory, and Port Kunda in 1879. In 1886 narrow-gauge was built to connect the cement factory with the port.

        Between the years 1896 and 1899, and also between 1910 and 1912 the factory grew and the second and the third cement factory were built.

        In connection with the expansion of the Kunda cement factory in the 1890s, they went from wet to dry process, the raw material marl was replaced by limestone.

        In order to meet the needs of factory´s new equip-ment, engine generators´ efficiency had to be increased.  In 1893 the first hydroelectric power station in the Baltic States and the third in the world was completed using the run of the River Kunda. The hydroelectric power station had a 240-horsepower turbine and its dynamo was shipped by an Oerlicon Company from Zurich. The station was blown off by receding German forces and was rebuilt in 1959.

        In 1888 an outstanding villa was built on the high bank of the River Kunda, which was used as a residence of the director´s family of the Kunda Cement Factory. They also established a park around the villa. It served as the Director´s House until 1944. The construction of the house was started by the first director of the cement factory, Victor Cristoph Lieven. Before the WW II directors Carl Joseph Oscar Lieven (1888–1895), Heinrich Ernst Eduard Bührig (1895–1913), Alexander Strauch (1913–1917) and Theodor Hansen (1920–1940 and 1941–1944) lived in the Director´s House. Among the other guests of the directors there have been also a polar researcher, a mysterious Sannikov´s Land seeker Edurard Gustav von Toll (1897), and famous geologists Carl August von Mickwitz (1897) and Carl Friedrich Schmidt. At the beginning of the Soviet period the house was transformed into Kunda workers´ house, which also accommodated the canteen and child day care rooms. Nowadays the building hosts the local cultural center - Kunda town club.

        In 1895 the board of the cement factory opened the elementary school for the children of factory workers. Port-Kunda one-class elementary school operated on the right bank of the River Kunda, in a one-floor stone building which stood under Hiiemägi. The building was turned into a schoolhouse between the years 1897 and 1906. A one-class elementary school had three stages which took 3 years. In a two-class elementary schools, one had to learn for five years. The financier of the school was the cement factory.

        In 1906 the school became a two-class factory school, which took 4 years to complete.

        In 1917 Port-Kunda Factory School and German School were united, and a 6-class Kunda Cement Factory School was formed. Later it was renamed Kunda Primary School and it served in the same house until 1934.
